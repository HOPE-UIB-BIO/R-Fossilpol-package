\usage{
proc_detect_duplicates(
  data_source,
  source_var = "source_of_data",
  n_subgroups = 1,
  maximal_distance = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_source}{Data.frame with sequences}

\item{source_var}{Character. Name of a column that indicates source of data}

\item{n_subgroups}{Number of subgroups to split the data based on the
geography. Sequences within subgroup will be tested only if subgroup
contains sequences form different \code{source_var}}

\item{maximal_distance}{Maximal Euclidean distance between two sequences to
consider them as material for comparison}
}
\value{
Data.frame with the suggested duplicates of sequences
\code{distance} = Euclidean distance between sequences
\code{similarity} = mean number of the exactly same columns
}
\description{
Function will split sequences based on their geographic
location into \code{n_subgroups}. If subgroup contains data from multiple sources,
Euclidean \code{distance} between all sequences combination will be calculated.
Only combination with the distance up to \code{maximal_distance} will be kept.
Next, selected columns will be compared between sequences and the average number of
the exact same columns is returned \code{similarity}.
