chron_recalibrate_ad_models(
  data_source,
  batch_size = 1,
  number_of_cores = 1,
  default_iteration = 10000,
  default_burn = 2000,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_source}{Data.frame containing \code{dataset_id} and \code{chron_control_format}}

\item{batch_size}{Number of individual sequences re-calibrate in a single
batch using parallel computation}

\item{number_of_cores}{Number of CPU cores to use in parallel computation}

\item{default_iteration}{The number of iterations used by Bchron}

\item{default_burn}{The number of starting iterations to discard used by Bchron}

\item{default_thin}{The step size for every iteration to keep beyond
the burnin used by Bchron}

\item{iteration_multiplier}{Value to be used to multiply \code{iteration}, \code{burn},
\code{thin} to keep the ratio between them same}

\item{set_seed}{User-defined seed for randomisations}

\item{batch_attemps}{Number of tries each batch should be considered
before skipping it}

\item{time_per_sequecne}{Time (in sec) dedicated for each sequence to estimate
age-depth model. If it takes computer longer that selected value, estimation
is considered as unsuccessful and skipped. The time value is mutliplied by
\code{iteration_multiplier} as more itiration required more time. Time for whole
batch is calculated as \code{time_per_sequecne} multiplied by \code{iteration_multiplier}
multiplied by the number of sequences per batch (which is estimated based on
\code{number_of_cores})}

\item{dir}{Path to the data storage folder}
